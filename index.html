                <li>At the age of 12, he had access to alcohol, marijuana, LSD, psilocybin, and prescription drugs, which he used daily until 14. He stopped for a year, but relapsed at 15</li>
                <li>As a teenager, he suffered with deep depression, causing him to drop out of school and almost never leave his house</li>
                <li>He credited Music for saving him during these times, however a bad PCP experience had him develop panic disorder and agoraphobia</li>

                <li>Their fourth album, <em>Superunknown</em>, was their "breakthrough" album, debuting at number one on the <em>Billboard 200</em>, and cementing them as one of the most influential bands of all time</li>
